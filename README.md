# Dataset_generator-project

It is our project to collect the datasets from various sources and if we don't have that dataset in any datascience websites then we create dataset from the existing information...

After downloading all these files in your local machine, open the command line or terminal and go to that folder
then use "python manage.py runserver" to produce local host address, use that address in your browser.
(manage.py is the file name).
